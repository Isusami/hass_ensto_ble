# hass_ensto_ble
_Custom component to read and write data from Ensto BLE thermostats._

## Note
- This is a development version. It's a hobby project and will be developed slowly for my own purposes. Please be patient.
- Integration tested on Raspberry PI 4, Home Assistant OS 15.2, Supervisor 2025.05.3, Core 2025.5.3. The intergration is not guaranteed to work with other types of HA installations.
- Integration tested with Ensto ELTE6-BT and ECO16BT thermostats but should work with all Ensto thermostat supporting the same BLE Interface Description.
- The version v0.3.5 onwards works with multiple thermostats.
- The version v0.2.1 onwards works with ESP32 Bluetooth proxies.


## If you have trouble pairing your thermostat
Some users have needed additional pairing in the terminal to establish a Bluetooth connection.

- In Home Assistant terminal, run bluetoothctl. You can continue entering commands while Bluetooth messages appear on screen.
- First type trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (replace with your device's MAC address)
- Second type pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (replace with your device's MAC address)
- Set your Ensto BLE thermostat to pairing mode (blue light blinking)
- Proceed adding the Ensto BLE thermostat in Home Assistant
  
## If you want to remove the device and add it again
- Should remove from bluetoothctl and do the trust and pairing again, bluetoothctl remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (replace with your device's MAC address)

### HACS installation
1. Search the repository `HASS Ensto BLE` from HACS default repositories
2. Download the latest release to HACS
3. Restart HA
4. Go to Settings > Devices & services > Add Integration
5. Search for "Hass Ensto BLE"

The integration will automatically scan for Ensto BLE thermostats in pairing mode.

During installation, you must choose a currency for energy calculations (only stored in the thermostat)

To put your thermostat in pairing mode:
- Hold the BLE reset button for >0.5 seconds
- The blue LED will start blinking when pairing mode is active

### Manual installation

1. Navigate to your Home Assistant configuration directory (where `configuration.yaml` is located)
2. Create a `custom_components` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Create a directory called `hass_ensto_ble` inside `custom_components`
4. Download all files from this repository
5. Place the downloaded files in the `custom_components/hass_ensto_ble` directory
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. Go to Settings > Devices & services > Add Integration
8. Search for "Hass Ensto BLE"
   
## Supported functions
### Naming the Ensto BLE thermostat

1. Navigate to Developer Tools > Services
2. Select service `hass_ensto_ble.set_device_name`
3. Select a thermostat name entity if you have multiple thermostats
4. Enter a new name in the Name field (maximum 25 characters)
5. Click "PERFORM ACTION"

The new name will be visible:
- In the Devices & services > Integrations page
- In the device card when you click on the device
- Please note that entity names for the device are not renamed

The name is stored directly in the thermostat's memory and persists through restarts.

### Setting heating mode
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Select a mode from the drop down menu.

All Ensto BLE thermostats do not support all modes.

Floor temperature min / max values are only used in the Combination heating mode.
Boost power offset and vacation power offset are only used in the Power heating mode

### Enable boost mode
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Set Boost duration in minutes
3. Set Boost temperature offset (-20C to 20C) or boost power offset (-100% to 100%) if you're using Power heating mode
4. Enable "Ensto Boost Mode"
5. Sensor "Ensto Boost Remaining" will start counting from set boost time to zero and turn off automatically.

### Enable adaptive temperature control
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Enable "Ensto Adaptive Temperature Control". Note! This is a simple switch to enable/disable adaptive temperature change on the device.

### Change the floor sensor type
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Change the Floor sensor type from the drop down menu
3. After a while, the thermostat will return a new temperature value based on the new floor sensor type

### Set the device time
1. Home Assistant shows a notification if the device time differs more than one minute from Home Assistant time
2. Time is handled internally in UTC to ensure consistent operation across time zones
3. To synchronize the time:
   - Go to Developer Tools > Actions
   - Select service `hass_ensto_ble.set_device_time`
   - Select your thermostat's DateTime entity
   - Click "PERFORM ACTION"
4. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
5. Verify that the DateTime sensor shows the correct local time
6. The notification will automatically disappear once the time is synchronized

The notification will automatically disappear once the time is synchronized.

### Setting Daylight saving

1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > [Your Ensto thermostat] > Entities
2. Find the Daylight Saving switch
4. Turn the switch on or off as needed
   - The device will automatically convert between UTC and local time based on this setting

### Setting Floor Temperature Limits
1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > [Your Ensto thermostat] > Entities
2. Find the Floor Min and Max Temperature
3. Adjust as needed
   - The minimum temperature must always be at least 8 degrees lower than the maximum limit
   - These settings are only used in combination heating mode
   - In other heating modes, the sensors will be disabled

### Setting Room Sensor Calibration value
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Find the Room Sensor Calibration number entity
3. Set a value between -5.0°C and +5.0°C to calibrate the room temperature sensor
   - Positive values increase the displayed temperature
   - Negative values decrease the displayed temperature

### Setting Heating Power
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Find the Heating Power entity
3. Adjust the power level

Changes are stored in the thermostat's memory

### Configuring Floor Area
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Find the Floor Area entity
3. Set the floor area

Changes are stored in the thermostat's memory

### Comprehensive Energy Monitoring
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Find the power usage sensor. It includes the following information as attributes:
   - Last 24 hour thermostat on/off ratio tracking
   - Last 7-day thermostat on/off ratio tracking
   - Last 12-month thermostat on/off ratio tracking
   - Hourly floor and room temperature readings

### Setting Vacation Mode
1. Navigate to Settings > Devices & services > [Your thermostat]
2. Find and configure the vacation end times
3. Configure the vacation temperature offset (-20C to 20C) or vacation power offset (-100% to 100%) if you're using Power heating mode
4. Enable the vacation mode switch. The thermostat will turn on the vacation mode on and off when the vacation start and end times are reached.

Temperature and power offset values and date settings will automatically update in the UI.
